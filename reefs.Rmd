## Reefs description {.unnumbered}

### Study sites

The surveyed area is located in the central region of the Inhambane Province and included a 56 km stretch of coastline with four shallow reef structures (Baixo Africa, Baixo Zambia, Pomene, and Baixo Silvia) indicated on navigation charts and known by local communities as fishing and diving operators. All reef formations are located between 0.5 to 6.5 kilometers from the shore (figure 1) and within a depth range from 5 to 32 meters. Ponta Pomene (herein called Pomene) and Baixo Zambia are sites previously known for diving activities (Pereira et al., 2018), while the reefs of Baixo Silvia and Baixo Africa had only recently been visited by recreational divers as reported by local fishermen. Previous to this study, there was no record or official registers considering those reefs (Baixo Africa and Baixo Silvia) in scientific surveys. <br><br>

#### 1) Baixo Silvia

Baixo Silvia is composed of three main reef structures connected by shallower flat areas located around 6 km from the shore and extending for 5.5 km. The highest structural complexity was found on the seaward edges of reefs, where formations drop from 8 to 28 meters. Some of the sampled points showed a more complex configuration forming small canyons (approximately 5 m wide, 6 m deep, 10 m long).

#### 2) Pomene

Pomene reefs are located on the coast of the Reserva Nacional do Pomene - RNP, which has several small local communities, private residences, and a commercial lodge with diving facilities within its borders (MTADR, 2006). Coastal reefs are located from 500 to 1000 m off the coast and are the easiest to access among all surveyed areas. The reef is composed of two main groups (north and south) separated by 1 km of flat sand and scattered reef bommies. In general, all reefs from Pomene have high structural complexity, with vertical structures, arches, and canyons, especially in the northern area.

#### 3) Baixo Zambia

Baixo Zambia reefs are formed by a group of moderately complex reefs located at 6.5 km from the shoreline, with depths ranging from 7 to 24 m. The reefs extend for 1.8 km in length and approximately 700 m in width. Following the pattern observed at the other reef formations, higher structural complexity was found on the edges on the seaward side, while the leeward side has a flat surface with sparse coral colonies.

#### 4) Baixo Africa

Baixo Africa reefs are grouped in a narrow formation following the coastline with a horseshoe shape on the north portion. Reefs are approximately 5 km distant from the shoreline and within a depth range from 7 to 24 m.

### Megafauna

The presence of humpback whales (*Megaptera novaeangliae*) seen in groups of mothers and calves and groups of dolphins (*Tursiops truncatus*) was constant during sampling. The Mozambique channel is a known migration corridor for humpback whales and the field work was done during the migration season, increasing the odds of those encounters. Hawksbill turtles (*Eretmochelys imbricata*) were observed resting and feeding at reefs, while loggerhead turtles (*Caretta caretta*) were observed mating in areas between Baixo Zambia and Baixo Silvia. These are indications that the region is used for feeding for all these groups above, and also for reproduction and nesting ground for sea turtles. Also, giant manta ray (*Mobula birostris*) and whale shark (*Rhincodon typus*) individuals were spotted in the sampled reefs, and although are known to occupy the Mozambique channel, their numbers are currently decreasing and they are currently classified as vulnerable and endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Although our investigation was focused on the description of reef fish and benthic assemblages, these observations of large vertebrates are relevant to environmental authorities and specialized researchers since few reports were registered in this part of the Mozambican coast. <br><br>
